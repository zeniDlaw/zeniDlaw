### About Me
The sense of freedom is what drives me. I am currently a student at 42 Wolfsburg and have been living in Germany since 2023. I am passionate about software development and am actively learning and growing my skills in this field.

### Current Focus
I am learning software development in C and working on various projects related to the 42 core. My journey at 42 Wolfsburg has been incredibly enriching, pushing me to think critically and solve complex problems.
